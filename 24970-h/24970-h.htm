<h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_A_ROBIN" id="THE_STORY_OF_A_ROBIN"></a>THE STORY OF A ROBIN.</h2>


<p>One fine summer morning two old
robins were consulting about breaking
up their household. In other words,
they thought the time had come when
their young ones should turn out of the
nest and find food for themselves. There
were five little birds in that nice, warm
nest, but it was much too small for them
now that they were so well feathered; and
as they quarrelled terribly about getting
the best place, the weakest one was in
danger of being tumbled over the side
with the pushing and struggling that went
on. Then they were such hungry birds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that their parents could not find enough
of food to satisfy them, and the poor old
birds were getting quite thin, and were
tired flying from their nest to the plot
where the gardener was raising some early
potatoes, which was the best place to find
food, and back with their mouths full.</p>

<p>Cock Robin said to his wife,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is going to be a very warm day,
and I am not going to work all through
the sunshiny hours feeding birds old
enough to look after themselves. We
shall say we are going away for a holiday,
as we require change of air, and they
must go and find their own food. Don&rsquo;t
look so sad, my dear; it is the way of the
world. The same thing happened to us.
I wonder what my father would have said
had I screamed to him for food when I
was the age my sons are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Robin listened dutifully to this
long speech, and, like a good wife, acquiesced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in what her husband said. But as
she flew with him to tell the youngsters of
the change awaiting them, her heart was
a little sore on account of her latest
hatched birdie. He was not so big or so
strong as the others, and she feared he
might be caught by a cat or die of cold.
However, it was no use dwelling on these
dismal ideas; he must just take his chance,
as all birds before him had done. She
would give him some good advice as to
avoiding cats, and the proper drying of
his feathers when they got wet, so that
he should not get rheumatism in his bones.</p>

<p>On reaching the nest, they found there
had been a fierce fight among their children.
All the five were out of the nest,
and four of them were on the ground
fluttering and screaming, each trying to
tell its own story and throw the blame on
its neighbour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this noise?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
said Cock Robin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Robinette?&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Robin. &ldquo;Has a cat or a weasel been
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chip, chip, chip was heard among
the leaves close to the deserted home, and
the mother flew up to see if her darling
was all right, leaving the father of the
family to settle matters with the others.
Robinette was safe, and as he took the
breakfast his mother had brought him, he
told her what a fight there had been, and
how he in the struggle had been pushed
over the side. He also told her he could
use his wings so well that he had been
able to steady himself and keep from falling,
until he found a branch that he could
rest on comfortably. And there he had
waited for his mother&rsquo;s return, knowing
that she would bring him something good
to eat.</p>

<p>The poor mother was wondering how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
she was to tell her wee birdie that this
was the last breakfast she would bring
him, when he introduced the subject himself
by saying he wished he had not to get
back into that nest. Indeed he did not
think he could do it, for his wings were
so stretched with using them that he was
sure they would never crumple up into so
small a space as they used to occupy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seeing that your wings are grown,
my son, your father has decided we must
all fly away. Let us join him now, and
hear what he is saying to your brothers
and sisters. He is very angry about this
quarrelling, which is out of all order, and
quite contrary to the doctrine taught by
Dr. Watts that &lsquo;Birds in their little nests
agree;&rsquo; and he does not like to think
that his children are naughty beyond
all others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robinette obediently accompanied his
mother to the ground, and Mrs. Robin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was glad to see how cleverly he managed
both legs and wings. They found Cock
Robin still haranguing his unruly family;
but on seeing his wife, he concluded his
remarks thus,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are old enough and strong
enough to do for yourselves, so off you go.
Your mother and I will look after Robinette,
and keep an eye on you for a day or
two to see how you get on. I hope the
gardener will be considerate enough to
leave those worm-enticing carrots in the
ground, for then there will be plenty of
food for us all. Now good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cock Robin, having dismissed the four,
turned to his wife and Robinette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, my dear, he was not hurt by
his rough brothers and sisters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;he was not hurt;
and I am now satisfied that his legs and
wings are all they should be. As for his
brains, he has more in his little head than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
all the others put together. I feel sure
Robinette will have a history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cock Robin put his head first to one
side, then to the other, and gave a funny,
chirrupy laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! you mother birds are all alike;
you think your special nursling is sure to
turn out the flower of the flock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us fly away. There is an uncomfortable
feeling about my feathers, plainly
telling me there is a cat near us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment there was a rustle
among some leaves, and a beautiful tabby
cat came into view close to where the
birds were. Robinette got such a fright
that he rose suddenly from the ground,
and he seemed to go on rising, rising, until
he was far away from his home in the
rhododendron bush.</p>

<p>In his pleasure at finding himself going
along so easily up in the air he quite forgot
the cat, and, alas! he forgot his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
parents too. He forgot everything but
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a big place the world is!&rdquo;
thought he, as he sat on a branch of a large
walnut-tree and looked round about him.</p>

<p>He was rather tired, so he rested there
a while. Then he remembered that he had
no one to bring him his food now; he
must look for it himself. So he spread
his wings and let himself gently down to
the ground, where he soon found some
earth newly turned over, and there was a
feast for a king. Oh, those thoughtless
wire-worms playing in the sunshine, they
little knew who was just going to pounce
upon them!</p>

<p>Robinette was now quite &ldquo;on his own
hook,&rdquo; as people who speak slang say.
There was no one to consult as to what he
should do; and though this freedom was
enjoyable in the full daylight, he began to
feel lonesome as evening drew on. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
found a good supper where he had found
his dinner, then crept into a nice, thick
rose-bush, dropped a silent tear as he
thought of his mother, and tucking his
head under his wing, fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>For some time Robinette&rsquo;s life was
much the same day by day. He met
with no accidents, and had no adventures.
However, one morning he saw something
new and strange. He was on his usual
point of observation&mdash;the branch of the
walnut-tree&mdash;when he saw the gardeners
bringing a long seat and putting it against
the trunk of his tree. Then a neat maid
from the house brought cushions and rugs.
Next came a lady, and seated herself comfortably
among those cushions and rugs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This must be &lsquo;the mistress&rsquo; I hear the
men speak about. She is evidently at
home here, and looks as though she were
some one of importance; but, poor thing,
she seems lonely. I am lonely too. I don&rsquo;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
care for the other birds in the garden;
they are a common lot with no manners.
I&rsquo;ll get acquainted with &lsquo;the mistress.&rsquo;
From what the men say, it is a wise thing
to be on friendly terms with those in
authority. I&rsquo;ll go down and speak to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this he flew down near to the lady&rsquo;s
feet. She was reading <i>The Standard</i> with
close attention, and did not see the wee
bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chip, chip, chip,&rdquo; said Robinette&mdash;his
way of saying &ldquo;good-morning,&rdquo; you know.</p>

<p>Down went the newspaper with a
crackling noise that somewhat alarmed
him, so he withdrew to what he thought
a safe distance. He flew to a dahlia
stake, and from there again addressed the
lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chip, chip, chip. Ah! she sees me
now,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>The lady looked and saw him. He
came near her, almost to her feet again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Robinette was very brave&mdash;whether from
real courage or from ignorance is a disputed
point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a very friendly bird! You seem
quite tame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what she means,&rdquo; thought
the birdie. &ldquo;Chip, chip, chip,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come near, robin; I shall not hurt
you. Sing me a song.&rdquo; And the lady
made that curious, kissing sound with her
lips that people always make when speaking
to birds.</p>

<p>Robinette thought she was very polite
to sing to him on such a slight acquaintance;
and not to be behind in his manners,
he sang to her with his strange, twittering
note. The two conversed and sang to
each other for some little time, when
another lady came under the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do look at that funny, little bird,
Polly; it has been hopping about close to
me, and seems very tame. We must bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
some crumbs next time we come out.&mdash;Good-bye,
Robin; but really you are so
small that we shall call you Robinette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies moved away, and the bird was
left wondering what &ldquo;crumbs&rdquo; were like.</p>

<p>For some days after this the rain came
down so fast that poor Robinette had
much ado to keep himself dry. He
cowered under his rose-bush or kept close
to the thick hedge; but all the places
got so very wet that the poor wee birdie
thought life was not worth living. However,
just as he was in the depths of
despair, out came the sun from behind the
clouds, and soon all nature was rejoicing
again. The two ladies came out from the
house to breathe the perfume-laden air
and to enjoy the sounds of reviving nature.
Robinette was so glad to see them that he
flew quite close to them, saying in his own
way, &ldquo;Good-day to you&mdash;chip, chip, chip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is Robinette, I declare,&rdquo; said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Polly; &ldquo;how wet and draggled he looks,
poor birdie! He needs the sun to dry his
wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day was all that could be
wished in the way of heat and bright sunshine,
so the ladies came to the garden
seat. Robinette was looking out for
them, and could scarcely wait for the
older lady to be settled among the
cushions and wrapped up in the rugs by
her daughter. There are treacherous
draughts under trees, and Polly was very
careful of her mother. At last all arrangements
were complete, and Mrs. Lewis
opened her book to read. Suddenly Robinette
flew on to it, quite startling her by
such an approach. But she was charmed
with his trusting familiarity, and at once
asked Polly for the crumbs she had
brought out. Polly produced them from
her useful apron pocket, and threw some
gently on the grass at her feet, and Robinette<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was soon eating the finest feast he
had ever had.</p>

<p>You may be sure, after having eaten
these good things, Robinette was always
watching for the ladies, and he hopped
beside them and sang to them as they
walked or worked in the garden. He was
soon tame enough to eat from their hands,
and Polly, looking upon him as a great
curiosity, wished to show him off to some
gentlemen friends. But Robinette obstinately
refused to be made a spectacle
of. Not the most enticing crumbs would
bring him to her hands if strangers were
near, particularly of the male sex. He had
no faith in men.</p>

<p>As the summer days passed away, and
autumn came and went, the days became
shorter and colder, and Robinette found
his way into the house, and soon was as
much at home there as in the garden.
He made friends with the cook in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
kitchen, and had many a rich meal when
she was preparing the family dinner. He
knew all the meal-times. He came in by
the morning-room window in time for
breakfast. But there he ran some risks.
He sometimes encountered the table-maid,
who was very cross with him; and perhaps
not without reason, for he was not
particular to wipe his feet before flying on
to the clean white table-cloth, and often
left the marks of his claws all over it; so
she feared her mistress would insist on
her changing the cloth. As this young
woman especially disliked extra work, she
used to frighten Robinette nearly out of
his senses by shaking her duster at him
and pretending to catch him.</p>

<p>Whenever the ladies came downstairs he
was quite safe. They let him do what he
liked. He tasted the bacon, he feasted
on butter, he burned his toes on the tea-pot&mdash;in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
fact, he did whatever came into
his little head. At lunch he again presented
himself, and he came to the
drawing-room for afternoon tea.</p>

<p>With all this high living he became a
big, fat bird, and I am sorry to say he
was very selfish and very jealous. He
could not endure the thought of any
other bird sharing his privileges, as the
following incident proves.</p>

<p>One morning after breakfast he heard
a noise in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever is Polly speaking to? It
must be another bird,&rdquo; said he to himself.
&ldquo;That is the way she speaks to me. I
must see to this. If it is another robin, I
shall be the death of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ruffled up his feathers and flew into
the hall, prepared to do battle with any
intruder. He was very angry to hear
Polly speak in such petting tones to any
bird but himself, and he was tempted
to give her ear a bite as he sat on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
shoulder. He found he had put himself
in a rage very needlessly. It was not
another robin, but a little wren.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I wonder what
she wants.&mdash;Good-day, Miss Wren; are
you coming to live here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of it,&rdquo; she replied,
tossing her head; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think the
society is very select.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she made this speech, she gave it
point by looking straight at Robinette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are rather a
small person to have formed such a large
opinion; but as you are so small, you are
welcome to stay as long as you do not
interfere with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for nothing, Cock Robin.
I shall stay or I shall go without asking
your leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a very rude bird, Jenny Wren.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I, Cock Robin? There are various
opinions about that. What a great, fat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
clumsy bird you are, to be sure! I would
not have you for a husband though there
were not another bird in the garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will perhaps wait until you are
asked, Miss Wren,&rdquo; replied Robinette,
feeling he had better retire from the argument
after this retort, for Jenny, like all
females, would try to have the last word.</p>

<p>Polly had been watching the birds
fluttering towards each other, and was a
little fearful Robinette might be rough
with Jenny, so she was glad to see them
part company after simply speaking, as
she thought.</p>

<p>This is the only incident worth mentioning
that occurred during the winter
months. Robinette&rsquo;s life was happy and
comfortable. Free to come and go as he
pleased, he always felt himself a guest&mdash;never
a prisoner.</p>

<p>At last winter was over, and the garden
was beginning to have more attractions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
There were some rather pretty Miss
Robins flying about, and our bird thought
he must go a-courting. He could not
easily make up his mind whether he
should bring a wife into the house, or
whether he should go and live in the
garden with her. Finally he decided on
the latter plan.</p>

<p>One very fine morning he dressed his
feathers most carefully, saw that each one
was lying exactly over the other, that his
brown coat was perfect and his red waist-coat
faultless. He practised his singing
until his love-song was all he could wish
it. He was wonderfully well satisfied
with himself; but Jenny Wren&rsquo;s impertinent
speeches would recur to his mind.
The words fat and clumsy had especially
annoyed him, and he never could altogether
rid himself of their effect.</p>

<p>As he flew past the greenhouse he saw
a bucket with pure, clear water in it. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
thought he would rest on the edge and
take a drink. Imagine his delight when
he saw reflected in the water a perfectly
beautiful cock robin, as charming a bird
as any one could desire to see. After
such a vision, what cared he for Jenny
Wren and her impudence? Away he
went, flying up and down the garden,
quite sure that no Miss Robin in her
senses would say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to him.</p>

<p>He rested a while on the branch of an
apple-tree, while he meditated on the
various Miss Robins, and considered to
which he should pay his addresses. He
was startled by a slight movement of
some leaves just beneath him, and on
looking down to find the cause, he saw his
too candid friend Jenny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are come out a-courting?&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;You are not a bit thinner.
Which of the Miss Robins do you think
will have you&mdash;a fat, over-fed house-bird?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite mistaken, Miss Wren,
if you think I am out for any such purpose.
I am only taking an airing this fine
day. A-courting, indeed! A bird like
you would frighten any bachelor. I am
sorry for your husband, if you ever get
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away he flew, for he did not like Miss
Wren&rsquo;s remarks. You see, he had not
mixed much with other birds, so he had
not, as it were, found his level. He was
in danger of thinking too much or too
little of himself; and then, you perceive,
he was thin-skinned.</p>

<p>Poor birdie! That pert young Jenny
had put his spirits down to his very toes.
Had it not been for the glimpse he got in
the bucket, he would have returned to the
house discouraged for that day. However,
like many other creatures, he did
not know what the near future had in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
store for him.</p>

<p>The time of day was noon, and he bethought
him the kitchen dinner would be
ready; so he prepared to fly towards the
house, as he was very hungry. Just at
this moment he caught sight of the gardener
turning over some stuff for a hot-bed,
and he also saw some fine, fat worms
thrown to the surface by the fork. He
concluded to dine there that day, and proceeded
to make a very satisfactory meal.
He had with some difficulty swallowed a
very large worm, when he heard the gardener
say, &ldquo;Hush! gently; now we shall
see some fun.&rdquo; Robinette looked up.
He saw, and he loved. The daintiest
Miss Robin in all the garden was hopping
towards him. Alas! beside her was a fine
cock robin, and they seemed on the pleasantest
terms with each other, and hopped
along, quite unaware of Robinette&rsquo;s presence.
To be ignored was what he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
not stand. So he came near to them,
made a deep bow to the lady, and ruffled
his feathers and scowled at his rival. A
fierce rage and jealousy took possession of
him. He would kill this bird or die in
the fight. The other cock robin was as
eager for the fray as he was; so these two
little birds were soon fighting savagely for
the lady of their choice. She watched
the duel from a twig close by. She had
made up her mind to marry the winner,
and it did not seem to matter much which
that was. Both were handsome; and the
victor would prove himself the stronger.
The birds were very equally matched, and
fought for some time with varying fortune.
At last, however, Robinette was conqueror,
and he flew at once to the lady
and claimed her as his bride. He knew
he now had a right to her; but just in case
her mind should waver towards another,
he placed before her the advantages of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
alliance with him, the chief one being that
he could get as much food as ever they
could eat, with very little trouble, and the
food was of the most rare and nourishing
kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can get some for you now, for I see
my friends in the garden, and Polly is
sure to have crumbs in her pocket. Wait
here until I come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies had come out for a stroll in
the garden. What a garden that was!
At almost any season it was beautiful, but
in the summer it was a paradise alike for
birds and human beings. It was surrounded
by grand old trees of many kinds
and flowering shrubs as large as trees.
Then the wealth of roses and sweet-scented,
old-fashioned flowers of all sorts,
mixed here and there with their more
modern sisters, made it a perfect dream of
delight. How the town-wearied friends
rejoiced when they were bidden to visit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that garden! There their eyes were refreshed
by the softly-blended colouring
and exquisite beauty of the whole scene.
They breathed in the delicious air, and
thought it better than wine as a restorer of
strength. No words can describe the feeling
to the feet of those soft, green avenues&mdash;the
grass so short that the most delicate
could walk there without harm, and so
smooth that a child&rsquo;s bare foot could run
there scathless. That garden is now to
those dear friends a place in their memory
only. The ladies have passed away from
it, and strangers are in possession.</p>

<p>Excuse this digression.</p>

<p>Robinette flew to Polly&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So here you are, Bobbie. We wondered
what had become of you, as you did
not come in at lunch-time. Don&rsquo;t fill your
mouth so full; you will choke yourself.
Oh! he is off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Polly had held the crumbs for him as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
usual, and he just stuffed his mouth full
and flew in the direction of the greenhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, Robinette must have a lady-love.
He has taken the crumbs away;
he did not swallow them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Robinette was charmed with the
crumbs&mdash;that kind of food suited her taste
exactly; and she hoped her husband would
keep her well supplied with them when she
was too much occupied with other matters
to seek food for herself. Robinette gallantly
promised to do his best for her.</p>

<p>Now it was time to seek a place for
their nest, and begin building. Like most
young people under similar circumstances,
they were difficult to please. Robinette,
having been so much accustomed to a
house, thought the greenhouse the best
place; Mrs. Robinette, knowing nothing
about houses, thought a nice, thick bush
much superior. She, like a good wife,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
gave in to her husband, and allowed him
to choose the site for their nest. He
selected a nice, quiet corner of the greenhouse,
beside some large flower-pots that
looked as if they had not been disturbed
for a century. Here they would be safe
from storms and cats and all creatures
which terrify small birds. As evening was
drawing on, our little lovers parted, having
appointed a place to meet next morning
at sunrise to begin to build their nest.</p>

<p>The following day the sun rose bright
and beautiful, making all things and creatures
rejoice, and none more than our two
little birds, who were soon as busy as
possible, finding and bringing the materials
necessary for their purpose.</p>

<p>They had such a happy time building
that nest; he was so gallant and she was
so sweet. How he sang to her when she
was tired, and what delicious crumbs he
brought her! Some shortbread had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
sent to Polly as a present, and it is such
a crumbling cake that the birds feasted
royally while it lasted.</p>

<p>At last the nest was finished. The little
builders looked it all over and could find
no fault with it. As they were rather
exhausted with their hard work, they
agreed to rest themselves a while near the
hot-bed where the memorable fight had
taken place. There they could find plenty
of worms without fatigue, and they would
sleep or chat as they felt disposed. When
they were sufficiently rested, they went
back to look at their pretty, new house.
Alas! alas! what desolation they found!
The gardener, who had been cleaning
his greenhouse, had moved the big, dirty
flower-pots, and had thrown out the robins&rsquo;
nest. Poor, tired birds, they had to begin
all over again. Mrs. Robinette burst into
tears, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you not to choose a house to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
build in; I was sure a bush would have
been safer. Do, dear husband, come away
now to some other place; I do not like
the men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robinette was very angry at his work
being spoiled, and he answered a little
sharply,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, my dear; I am not going to
be driven out of my way by a stupid old
gardener. We shall build here again.
Let us set to work at once; and if that
man interferes I shall tell the mistress.
Hallo! here is a piece of good-luck for us;
he has only thrown it down here. To be
sure, it is torn to pieces. But never mind;
we shall soon have it up again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You see Robinette had a temper; but
he was a cheery wee bird, inclined to
make the best of things. When his anger
had cooled, he chirped to his down-hearted
little wife so brightly that she was obliged
to pluck up spirit, and they were soon as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
merry as before the terrible misfortune.</p>

<p>A few days after these events Mrs.
Lewis came into her greenhouse, and seeing
it look so much brighter and lighter
than usual, she said to the gardener,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must acknowledge that the house
looks better for being clean. Try to keep
it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, ma&rsquo;am; but it is not much
use when these mischievous birds come in,
bringing their stuff to build with. Just
look there. I threw away a nest from
that very spot three days ago, and there
is another. And there is a robin in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Robinette,&rdquo; cried Polly. &ldquo;I am
sure it is.&mdash;Bobbie, come for crumbs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robinette, sly bird, had been watching
and listening; and when he saw that attention
was drawn to the nest, he sat down
in it as though he were the lady on her
eggs, knowing well &ldquo;the mistress&rdquo; would
give orders that he was not to be disturbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
And when she saw it was her
own pet robin, of course she was more
decided, and told the gardener he was on
no account to take down the nest, and
every possible arrangement was to be
made for the comfort and happiness of
Robinette and his wife.</p>

<p>It is customary to close all stories when
the hero marries. So, having come to the
end of Robinette&rsquo;s bachelor days, we shall
take leave of him and his bride, hoping
that, now they are married, they will
&ldquo;live happy ever after.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="APPLE-PIE_ORDER" id="APPLE-PIE_ORDER"></a>APPLE-PIE ORDER.</h2>


<p>What a bright, sunshiny forenoon!
and how green the meadow
looked before Simon Copland&rsquo;s farm!
The thrush in the great thorn was
singing loudly, and the old clock, which
stood in its dark oak case in the corner
of the kitchen, struck twelve as little
Ph&oelig;be came into the porch.</p>

<p>This little girl, though, whose face was
so sad, and whose straw-hat hung so
droopingly from her arm, was not like the
Ph&oelig;be of most days, who, on her return
from school about this hour, came popping
her happy little face in at the door, and if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
dinner were ready, would eat hers quickly,
and be off again.</p>

<p>The kitchen at Simon Copland&rsquo;s was a
long, large room, and had great beams
across the ceiling, from which hung hams
and other good things. Mrs. Copland
was busy at the table, and near one of
the windows sat her brother, Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s
uncle, Roger, who lived some miles away
at pretty Lady&rsquo;s Mead, and who was
very dear to his little niece. To him,
however, she had no mind to go at
present, and would have slipped upstairs;
but he quickly spied out the little figure
in the doorway, and opened his arms
to her, saying, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the little lass;
give thy Uncle Rogie a kiss, Ph&oelig;be.&rdquo;
There was no escape for Ph&oelig;be, and
in a minute more she was on her uncle&rsquo;s
knee, while his large forefinger was placed
on the marks of tears on her cheeks,
and his kind inquiring eyes asked as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
well as his words, &ldquo;Ph&oelig;be, my lass,
what ails thee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother turned round from the table.
&ldquo;What is it, Ph&oelig;be?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>And then came a burst of tears
from the little girl, and a confession,
poured into Uncle Roger&rsquo;s ear, of misfortunes
that day, and many days before,
at Mrs. Nott&rsquo;s school in the village;
how diligently Ph&oelig;be had always prepared
her lessons overnight, but how first
one book was lost, and then another;
and how to-day, because the pencil had
been carelessly fastened to the slate, it too
had disappeared, and was not there when
wanted, and in consequence Margaret
Prettyman had got above her&mdash;sly Margaret
Prettyman, who often did not learn
her lessons at all, but kept her place at
the head of the class by writing down her
task on a slip of paper, and keeping it in
her hand while she repeated it; and how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Mrs. Nott had said that Margaret was so
tidy and Ph&oelig;be so careless; and how she
reproved the latter when the class was
over, and told her that, unless girls were
tidy and careful, all their learning was of
no use. &ldquo;Every girl ought to keep
herself and her things in apple-pie order,&rdquo;
Mrs. Nott said. &ldquo;And, O uncle,&rdquo; sobbed
Ph&oelig;be, &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m careless, but I never
can remember to be tidy; and I can&rsquo;t keep
apple-pie order, for I don&rsquo;t know what it
is.&rdquo; And so, with many more tears,
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s confession ended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, child,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as
I&rsquo;ve often told you. Your drawer is a
shame to be seen; and I&rsquo;m glad Mrs.
Nott spoke to you as she did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Roger stroked his chin, and sat
looking out through the window for a
little, saying nothing, till Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s sobs
grew less frequent, and at last almost
ceased. He then reached his hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
through the open lattice, and pulling a
little flower from among the creepers,
gently raised Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s face, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look thee here, little niece; mark
this small, pretty flower, with its white
blossoms so perfect and tidy; look at the
stalk below, and each little leaf upon it,
regular, one after the other. There isn&rsquo;t
one part of this pretty flower out of its
place, Ph&oelig;be; and who made it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s sobs ceased altogether as she
replied, &ldquo;God, uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look there,&rdquo; Uncle Roger went
on, drawing towards him as he spoke a
large china dish, on which lay a beautiful
honeycomb, which Mrs. Copland had set
aside for a sick friend&mdash;&ldquo;look at this too.
See each cell, and each of these beautiful
little arches; there is not one unlike its
neighbour. What do you think of order
like that, niece Ph&oelig;be? isn&rsquo;t it perfect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, uncle,&rdquo; she whispered, quieted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and wondering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, little lass, our God, who made
the pretty flower, and caused the bees to
make the sweet honeycomb, is a God of
order, and He loves order. He does not
wish my little Ph&oelig;be to be the untidy
little maid she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be lay quiet for a few minutes,
thinking to herself how kindly Uncle
Roger always spoke to her, and how
much easier it was to &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; with
him than with Mrs. Nott or Margaret
Prettyman. &ldquo;But what did Mrs. Nott
mean by &lsquo;apple-pie order,&rsquo; uncle?&rdquo; she
said after a little, looking up in her uncle&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>Uncle Roger smiled and smoothed her
hair, not saying anything for a moment
or two; then, instead of answering her
question, he asked, &ldquo;When is your birthday,
Ph&oelig;be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The twenty-sixth of next month,&rdquo; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
replied quickly, and wondering very much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; continued Uncle
Roger, &ldquo;the custard feast I gave you last
birthday? I&rsquo;ve been asking your mother
here to bring you over this year too to
Lady&rsquo;s Mead, and I&rsquo;ll give you another
feast, and father, and mother, and Bob,
and little Charlie; and we&rsquo;ll have Uncle
and Aunt Leyton, and little Mary-Anne
to keep you company; and then, Niece
Ph&oelig;be, I&rsquo;m thinking of showing you
by that time what apple-pie order is.
Don&rsquo;t you know how good Uncle Roger&rsquo;s
apple-pies are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O uncle!&rdquo; cried Ph&oelig;be, clasping him
closely round the neck; &ldquo;how good you
are to me, Uncle Roger&mdash;custards and
apple-pies, and Cousin Mary-Anne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair and softly,&rdquo; said her uncle,
loosening her hold. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard
it all yet, Ph&oelig;be. It is nearly a month
till that, you know. Well, you must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
promise me that every day of that month
you will please your mother by keeping
your drawer, or whatever it is, as tidy
as a nut; and I must have from Mrs.
Nott a good account of your order and
neatness. Mind, <i>every day</i>; no books
lost, no pencils falling off, else no apple-pies
for you, Niece Ph&oelig;be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;O uncle!&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>Her mother looked round again.
&ldquo;Roger, you spoil the child,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if I teach her order, Sister
Marjory,&rdquo; was his reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>try</i>, uncle,&rdquo; whispered Ph&oelig;be;
and Uncle Roger kissed her.</p>

<p>You all know the difference well, I
don&rsquo;t doubt, betwixt <i>trying</i> and <i>doing</i>&mdash;how
easy it seems to perform a promise
at first, when resolves are fresh and
strong, but how each day takes, as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
were, a little bit of strength out of the
wish to do the disagreeable duty. Little
Ph&oelig;be was truly anxious to overcome her
bad habit; and I can also say that,
though apple-pies and custards, and her
dear little cousin Mary-Anne&rsquo;s company,
had at first given her an inducement to do
so, yet after a little that part of it became
very faint indeed in comparison with the
wish to succeed in fulfilling her promise
to Uncle Roger.</p>

<p>Difficult enough the task was; and
sometimes Ph&oelig;be felt as if the month
would never pass. But the days went on
somehow, and Mrs. Copland was much
amused, and secretly much pleased, to see
the important air with which her little
daughter would retire daily to her small
bedroom, next her father and mother&rsquo;s,
and after a great deal of knocking about
and noise overhead, would run downstairs,
and coming to Mrs. Copland, say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
&ldquo;Please, mother, come and look at my
drawer. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s tidy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a little time had passed, Mrs.
Copland explained to her daughter the
secret of true order; which is, not to
keep things untidy, and to have constantly
to <i>put them to rights</i>, but to <i>keep
them right</i>&mdash;to put everything in its own
place <i>at once</i>. This was a new part to
learn in Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s lesson, but she tried it,
and heartily too; and things were going
on in this way when, just two days before
the month was over, there came a sad
misfortune to her, which took away the
hopes of apple-pies and other things
which her birthday was to bring her.</p>

<p>All this time she had been going
regularly to Mrs. Nott&rsquo;s school, and the
schoolmistress was much surprised at the
change in her careless little pupil. Her
companions, too, could not tell what had
come to Ph&oelig;be Copland; and as for sly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Margaret Prettyman, she was filled with
dislike and envy of her little rival; for
Ph&oelig;be, having put aside her careless
habits, took her place as first in the class,
and Margaret had been first till now.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon Mrs. Nott
had given her girls an additional task to
learn; and Ph&oelig;be, having a quarter of an
hour to spare, sat down, as was her habit
sometimes, to look over the lesson before
leaving school. She was putting up her
books, when one of the other girls, Esther
Heywood, came to her with a message
from her (Esther&rsquo;s) mother, asking Ph&oelig;be
to step down to the Mill Farm, where the
Heywoods lived. They had got a jar of
fine citron-preserves, which the sailor son,
Jem, had brought from across the seas to
his mother; and she was going to send
some over to Mrs. Copland to taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might leave your books here,&rdquo; said
Esther, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll walk back a bit with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
you. We&rsquo;ll get them when we come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The citron-preserves were very, very
good, and Ph&oelig;be was kept a little while
at the Mill Farm to taste them, and to
hear the wonderful things which Jem
Heywood had to tell about the parrots
and the beautiful birds in the countries
where he had been; and then Ph&oelig;be
started on her way home over the fields,
and Esther with her. Sailor Jem said
he&rsquo;d &ldquo;go a bit too with the girls,&rdquo; to see
them &ldquo;under way,&rdquo; as he called it; and it
ended by Esther and Jem going the whole
way with her, to carry her books, which
they got as they passed the school-house.</p>

<p>All the evening Jem was telling them
such funny stories that she could not attend
to her lessons, but went to bed quite
tired with laughing, and dreamed that she
was a parrot, and that Jem Heywood was
teaching her tasks off by heart.</p>

<p>Next morning, with the sunshine, up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
jumped Ph&oelig;be, to learn her lessons before
going to school. She felt very happy. The
next day but one was her birthday; and
next day itself Uncle Roger would be
over from Lady&rsquo;s Mead, she knew, and
then she would tell him how faithfully she
had kept her promise; and how pleased
and kind he would look&mdash;she could fancy
she saw his face so well. And singing a
little song to herself, Ph&oelig;be sat down at
her bedroom window, opening her books
out before her on her knee. But there
were only three books there, and she
ought to have <i>four</i>.</p>

<p>How Ph&oelig;be sought for that book&mdash;through
all her drawers and her little
room, then through the house, and lastly,
down all the lane, and by every step of
the path through the fields which they
had crossed the evening before! Oh,
what a weary search that was, and
what a sad story to tell her mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
when, <i>without</i> the book, Ph&oelig;be returned.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Copland looked so vexed, what
would Uncle Roger be? And then all the
happy birthday pleasures which she had
lost! She would have to dine with little
Charlie, she knew, and to feel as if in
disgrace all day; and in disgrace even
Lady&rsquo;s Mead itself could bring her no
pleasure. Poor little Ph&oelig;be!</p>

<p>Her mother would not allow her to
stay at home from school, but said she
must tell Mrs. Nott the plain truth, and,
if she had time before the class began,
learn the lesson from some of the other
girls&rsquo; books. Fortunately, the missing
task was that which Ph&oelig;be had learned
before leaving the school the day before;
but, owing to her haste and agitation, it
was so incorrectly repeated that Margaret
Prettyman again triumphantly took her
place at the head of the class. It was
hard enough to see Margaret&rsquo;s malicious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
face as she pushed past, and Ph&oelig;be had
much trouble in choking down her temper
and her tears at the same time.</p>

<p>The next day Esther Heywood came
to meet her with a very sorrowful face,
and told her that Jem had been &ldquo;all up
the fields&rdquo; the evening before, searching
the path they had gone by, and that he
had looked into every nook and corner he
could think of, but he could not see the
book anywhere. His opinion was, though,
that Uncle Roger would never keep to
his word; that he would never disappoint
Ph&oelig;be on her birthday for such a trifle.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;be shook her head. &ldquo;Uncle Roger
always keeps his word,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be in disgrace, I know, though perhaps I&rsquo;ll
go to Lady&rsquo;s Mead all the same; but that
will be quite as bad as not going at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardest of all it was when Uncle
Roger came over that afternoon. Mrs.
Copland had to tell him the story, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Ph&oelig;be was so drowned in tears that she
could not speak a word. Uncle Roger
looked grave when he heard how it was,
but soothed his weeping little niece kindly,
and gave her no reproof. He spoke little
or nothing about the following day, only
saying, while stroking her hair as usual,
&ldquo;Well, my little maid, we must stick to
our bargain. Apple-pie order must wait
till next year, I fancy; but come over all
the same, and welcome, to Lady&rsquo;s Mead.
You and Mary-Anne can have your romp
together; and you must forget it&rsquo;s your
own birthday, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m just about
as much pleased with you for your last
month&rsquo;s doings as if all your books were
safe in your bag, mind you that; and now
wipe your tears, my little lass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning rose as bright and
beautiful as you could well wish to see,
and Ph&oelig;be, seated by her father behind
the old grey horse Robin, with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
mother and Charlie in the back seat,
almost forgot her sorrows while driving
down the sweet, shady lanes in all their
beautiful autumn colours, and while looking
forward to Lady&rsquo;s Mead, and the
delight of seeing her dear little cousin
Mary-Anne.</p>

<p>Lady&rsquo;s Mead was such a pretty place,
with a very large orchard full of rosy-cheeked
apples; and there was a dairy,
large, and cool, and sweet, with great
bowls of delicious milk, and such a beautifully
white, clean floor. Out of doors
there was a swing, and a pretty mossy
summer-house down by the stream, and
such delightful little paths through clipped
yew hedges, and an old sun-dial on the
grass, and in one corner a stone figure of
a little boy kneeling, with his hands
clasped and his face looking up to heaven.
It was altogether such a place as children
did not weary of; and had it not been for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
little Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s late troubles, she would
have been as joyous as the birds which
were singing in the trees all round them.</p>

<p>There were many &ldquo;rubs&rdquo; to bear,
though; first, the meeting with her uncle
and aunt and Mary-Anne, and receiving
from them no happy birthday wishes as
usual; and then seeing her brother Bob&rsquo;s
disappointed face when he came over
from the county town where he was
serving his apprenticeship, bringing with
him a nice little parcel, which looked very
like a doll, wrapped up in thin brown
paper, and stowed away in one of his
pockets for his little sister. The parcel
was not taken out, however.</p>

<p>Cousin Mary-Anne, who was a dear,
good little girl, no sooner heard that
Ph&oelig;be was to dine at a side-table with
little Charlie, instead of the treat of
sitting at the great long one with the
older people, than she declared that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
would do so too; and though Ph&oelig;be
would not listen to this at first, yet
Mary-Anne would have it so, and it
was accordingly settled. She proved
herself, too, such a good little comforter
and companion, that Ph&oelig;be became quite
cheerful again, though perhaps their play
was not quite so merry as usual.</p>

<p>First they went to the poultry-yard,
where there was a brood of very fine little
ducklings, just hatched, to see. Then to
the dairy, where they both were allowed
to pat away at the butter and make it up
for tea. Then Matty, the dairy-maid,
said that she must leave the dairy, and
that they must go too; so they sauntered
away down by the stream to the pretty
summer-house. They were glad to get
there, because of the shade, for the sun
was hot, and they were tired with butter-making.
So for some little time they sat
resting, and making boats of the large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
leaves, to float down the stream.</p>

<p>By-and-by they heard a step coming
quickly down the path towards them, and
directly afterwards Bob came hurrying
into the summer-house, saying, &ldquo;Ph&oelig;be,
come along; Uncle Roger&rsquo;s seeking you.&mdash;And
you, Mary-Anne, if you like, you
little duck;&rdquo; and with that Bob gave a
loud &ldquo;hurrah,&rdquo; which made both the girls
spring to their feet in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why, Bob?&rdquo; asked Ph&oelig;be excitedly,
as he hurried them along, one in each
hand, as fast as they could go up the path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; said Bob&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
soon know;&rdquo; and then he gave another
&ldquo;hurrah&rdquo; and jumped like a madman.</p>

<p>On they rushed, through the orchard,
round the yew hedge, and so past the old
dial, and over the grass, on to the house.
At the window, which was a very large
one, Ph&oelig;be saw quite a crowd; for they
were all collected there, and amongst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
them, to her astonishment, stood tall
Jem Heywood. When she and Bob and
Mary-Anne came in sight, he set up a
cheer, in which little Charlie joined
lustily; and Ph&oelig;be turned first red and
then pale, and at last stopped altogether
in fright and bewilderment, dragging the
two others back with her. Then her
father&rsquo;s face looked out and smiled to her,
and then her mother&rsquo;s and Aunt Leyton&rsquo;s;
and then out came Uncle Roger, and
Ph&oelig;be was lifted on his shoulder, and
carried through the midst of the smiling
faces to where the dinner was laid out.</p>

<p>There she saw a little bower of green
branches over a chair at Uncle Roger&rsquo;s
right hand, at the end of the table; and
on this chair, under the boughs, Uncle
Roger set her down, while before her
rose the most enormous apple-pie you
can imagine! Instead of crust, which it
looked like, its cover was of china-ware;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and Uncle Roger raised it in his hand
when every one had sat down all round
the table, and there&mdash;what do you think?
Ph&oelig;be saw the wonderful pie filled, not
with apples, but with beautiful birthday
gifts&mdash;Bob&rsquo;s doll, dressed all in pink
ribbons and lace; a little straw-hat,
trimmed with bright blue ribbons, from
Aunt Leyton; a pretty china cottage,
covered with roses, from Mary-Anne; a
beautiful little work-box, lined with red
silk, and filled with every pretty, useful
thing for sewing, and also a crown-piece
in it, from her father and mother; and
better than all these, a small Bible,
beautifully bound in purple velvet, with
gold clasps, from Uncle Roger; and
beside this lay <i>another book</i>, and with a
cry of surprise Ph&oelig;be saw before her,
torn and stained, her own lost lesson-book!
What a cheer rose up all round
the table! And sailor Jem cheered louder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
than any one. But all this joy was too
much for poor Ph&oelig;be, and she fell
a-crying on Uncle Roger&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>If any of you wish to know how the
lost book was found again, I must tell
you what Jem Heywood said about it,
though it won&rsquo;t be in his own words.</p>

<p>He had been down the evening before
at Mrs. Prettyman&rsquo;s (Margaret&rsquo;s mother),
and one of the little ones having come
toddling into the room, Jem had lifted
it on his knee, taking as he did so a
crushed, torn book out of its hand. On
the fly-leaf, though almost torn away,
Jem read, to his surprise, the first letters
of Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s name. The child said it had
got the book &ldquo;in Maggie&rsquo;s bag.&rdquo; Then
Margaret came in herself, and Jem asked
her what was the meaning of this. Her
angry, guilty face and confused replies
immediately roused his suspicions; and
on going home he took care to let his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
sister Esther know all he had seen and
heard. The truth was soon found out.
It was Margaret who had done this spiteful
thing, to bring disgrace upon Ph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>Can you all picture to yourselves
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s joy on this happy evening?
How grateful she was to Jem Heywood,
and how the hours flew away, supper-time
coming before the games seemed half
done! Ph&oelig;be found time, though, for
a long, happy talk with Uncle Roger;
and it was then she told him how she had
made up her mind not to quarrel with
Margaret because of all this, but to try, if
possible, to be better friends than before;
for she now saw, she said, that their
quarrelling had brought all this about.</p>

<p>I may as well add here, as some of you
may wish to know, that Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s resolution
had its own reward, for her change of
conduct seemed to bring about a change
in Margaret&rsquo;s too. Of course this took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
some time, for bad feelings cannot be
rooted up all at once. But as the months
passed on, every one could see a great
improvement in Margaret. Little beginnings
often bring much greater endings;
and Margaret could look back afterwards
to this time with feelings of gratitude for
the lesson which had been taught her by
means of one forgiving little heart.</p>

<p>On this birthday night Uncle Roger
was much pleased to hear Ph&oelig;be speak
as she did; and her happiness was quite
full when, drawing her on his knee, he
added, &ldquo;And my little Ph&oelig;be has shown
me that, with God&rsquo;s help, she has learned
the meaning of &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Apple-pie order</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
